# OMCLM

OMCLM makes DSP, soundfile I/O etc from the "Common Lisp Music"
project (CLM) available in [OM#](https://github.com/cac-t-u-s/om-sharp) (om-sharp).

CLM is a sound synthesis package written by Bill Schottstaedt
(bil@ccrma.stanford.edu).

OMCLM gives OM#-users access to Music-V type unit generators (UG) -
oscillators, filters, buffers, table-lookup, envelopes, soundfile
I/O - and routines to create and control DSP-instruments and
scorefiles in OM#.

In addition to typical audio-rate work, all the functions from CLM can
be used at higher-level composition or analysis work.

The library extends CLM with graphical classes, methods and editors,
to integrate CLM in OM# patches and workflows.

From CLMs homepage:

> Common Lisp Music is a music synthesis and signal processing package
> in the Music V family. It runs in a number of lisps or as a part of
> Snd (using Scheme or Ruby). The file README.clm has current status
> info for the Common Lisp versions. The mailing list for clm news is
> cmdist@ccrma.stanford.edu. Common Music, CMN, and the Snd editor
> also use this list.
>
> CLM has several sections: "generators", instruments (definstrument
> and *.ins), examples of note lists (with-sound, *.clm), a "make"
> facility for sound files (with-mix), and various functions that are
> useful in sound file work. CLM is available free
